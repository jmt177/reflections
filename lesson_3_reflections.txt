When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If others need to be able to see it in progress. Or if it takes up too much space on your machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case you don't want the changes in your local repository.
