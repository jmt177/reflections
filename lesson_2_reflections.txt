What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created, which tracks future changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediary. It contains only those files from the working directory you have entered, and
the repository contains none of them. Beyond the simple answer, it allows a moment to reflect on possible
mistakes, why would it be useful? The only difference is the working directory has those versions and
the repository doesn't. It is a bit of abstraction.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
by comparing the working directory to the staging area, to determine what has been changed that you
want to commit, then add those to the staging area. Again, run git diff --staged to view the 
difference between the staging area and the most recent commit to see a final comparison before you
decide to commit. Naturally, if you strive for one logical change per commit it is here you would see
if you are true to that idea.
