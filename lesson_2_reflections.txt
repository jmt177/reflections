What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created, which tracks future changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediary. It contains only those files from the working directory you have entered, and
the repository contains none of them. Beyond the simple answer, it allows a moment to reflect on possible
mistakes, why would it be useful? The only difference is the working directory has those versions and
the repository doesn't. It is a bit of abstraction.
